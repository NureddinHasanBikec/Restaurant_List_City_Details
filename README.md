## Overview

I cannot share app images as the API service is no longer open source.


### Built With


- [React-native](https://reactnative.dev/)


## Features

This app comprises use of Stack Navigation and RESTFUL Web APIs

- The user can type the name of the city in the search bar to select a city. The cities are filtered again each time you type a new letter. Or the user can select a city by scrolling down.
- When the user selects a city, a new page opens showing a list of restaurants in the selected city. This page consists of a picture and the names of the restaurants.
- The user can type the name of the restaurant in the search bar to select a restaurant. The restaurants are filtered again each time you type a new letter. Or the user can select a restaurant by scrolling down.
- When the user taps on the image of the chosen restaurent, a new page showing the detailed information of the restaurant opens. 
- User can be diverted to each restaurant's reservation URL by clicking on the "make a reservation" button.
